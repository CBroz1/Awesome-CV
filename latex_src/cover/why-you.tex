\lettersection{Why Northwestern?}
As my family prepares for a transition to Chicago, I seek to to transfer my skills to
new opportunities in the fields of data science and medical imaging. The Radiology
department's emphasis on patient-centered clinical services is inspiring and would
provide an impactful avenue for my skillset. I also expect that exposure to a diverse
range of medical disciplines would deepen my understanding of radiologic sciences,
driving my career forward.
