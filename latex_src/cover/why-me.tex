\lettersection{Why Me?}
This role requires both the technical skills related to coding and data infrastructure,
as well as collaborative skills related to management and working with larger
interdisciplinary teams. I have 8+ years of Python, R, SPSS, and shell scripting
experience, as well as direct experience working with researchers to develop tools to
meet project needs. I am confident I could grow the department's IT infrastructure to
expedite the research process and adapt to changing needs. \par Thank you for
considering my application for the Data Analyst Associate position. I am
excited about the opportunity to contribute my skills and knowledge to a department that
is making a meaningful difference in people's lives.
