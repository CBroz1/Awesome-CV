\lettersection{About Me}
I am excited to apply for the Data Analyst position at Northwestern. With a strong
background in academic neuroimaging research and data management solutions, as well as
excellent communication skills, I believe I am a great fit for this role. In my previous
roles, I have had the opportunity to work on a range of fMRI projects, developing tools
to automate preprocessing and otherwise facilitate research. I have experience working
with both structured and unstructured data, and automating research workflows. I also
have experience working with multi-disciplinary academic teams to take projects from
conception to publication.
