\begin{cvparagraph}
I am driven to find efficiencies by applying automation and reforming processes. I have
8+ years of experience in data management, analytics, visualization, leadership,
and dynamically acquiring project-relevant skills. In my recent start-up position, I
developed SQL databases for open-source and client projects using a Python and Docker,
while also developing scientific expertise and leading graphic design for social media
and conference presentations. I want to be the rising tide that lifts all ships as I
continue to grow as a data scientist and project manager.
